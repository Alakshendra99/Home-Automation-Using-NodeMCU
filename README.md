# Home-Automation-Using-NodeMCU
A basic Home Automation was done in this project. The device is accessible in local area network only.
The project consists
  - NodeMCU
  - 4 Channel Relay Module
  - BJT Transistors NPN
  - Resistors 10 Kohm
  - SMPS 220V AC To 12V DC
  - Voltage Regulator 7805
  - Voltage Regulator 1117-3.3

### Limitations of This Project
This was a very basic project to test the proof of concept.
This project lacks many development points as follows.
  - Connection To Cloud
  - Manual Control To Be Added
  - Proper Safety Casing

### Future Scope
Its a low-budget home-automation solution for lazy people like me.
Advance version of this has been developed by Suavy Technologies Private Limited. The properietry software and hardware is developed by me only. This project is published so that makers and hobbiest can implement Home Automation.
