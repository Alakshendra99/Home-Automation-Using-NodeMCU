# Home-Automation-Using-NodeMCU
A basic Home Automation was done in this project. The device is accessible in local area network only.
The project consists
  - NodeMCU
  - 4 Channel Relay Module
  - BJT Transistors NPN
  - Resistors 10 Kohm
  - SMPS 220V AC To 12V DC
  - Voltage Regulator 7805
  - Voltage Regulator 1117-3.3

This was a very basic project to test the proof of concept.
This project lacks many development points as follows.
  - Connection To Cloud
  - Manual Control To Be Added
  - Proper Safety Casing
